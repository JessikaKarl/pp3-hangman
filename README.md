## Deployment
This project is deployed with Heroku. This is how I deployed: 
* Clone or fork the repository
* Create a Heroku account
* Create a new app with Heroku
* In Settings add two buildpacks:
  1. Python
  2. NodeJS
* Link the new app to the repository for the project (Heroku and GitHub)
* Choose to enable Automatic Deploys or not. If enabled the depoyed app will update automatically with each push to GitHub
